Problem: 2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-distinct-integers-after-reverse-operations/

Level: Medium

Description:
You are given an integer array nums. For each integer in nums, you may reverse its digits (e.g., 123 â†’ 321).
After performing this reverse operation on every number, add both the original and reversed numbers into a collection.

Return the total number of distinct integers present in the collection.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,13,10,12,31]
Output: 6
Explanation:  
- Reverse(1) = 1  
- Reverse(13) = 31  
- Reverse(10) = 1  
- Reverse(12) = 21  
- Reverse(31) = 13  

Final distinct numbers = {1, 13, 10, 12, 31, 21} â†’ 6
